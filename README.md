Single-player Pong-like arcade game. The game supports four difficulty levels: "Easy" (1 px/frame vertical and horizontal), "Medium" (3 px/frame horizontal and 2 px/frame vertical), "Hard" (5 px/frame horizontal and 3 px/frame vertical), and an "Adaptive" level that starts at Easy and progresses to Hard with three intermediate steps. The difficulty is set via two switches.

Each game consists of three balls (lives), and the highest score is recorded.

The game is designed to be used with a VGA screen (640x480 @ 60 Hz).

The project has been developed employing the Terasic DE10-Lite Dev-Board that provides a 50 MHz clock signal to the FPGA. (FPGA: Intel MAX10 10M50DAF484C7G)
